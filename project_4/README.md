# 04. Determination of a favorable tariff for a telecom company

"Megaline" is a federal cellular operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which plan brings in more money.

## Research objectives
It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. The data of 500 "Megaline" users are available: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018.
It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.

## Conclusion

- The most profitable tariff is considered to be Ultra, which brings in an average of 2,070 per month from each user versus 1,290 from those on the Smart tariff;
- Average revenue does not depend on the city;
- The amount of minutes and messages in both tariffs are chosen correctly, and the majority of users are within the limits. The share of those who do not have enough allocated resources makes up about 20%;
- The amount of Internet traffic in both tariffs is not enough for 45% of users. Probably we should revise the tariff plans and increase the limits.
