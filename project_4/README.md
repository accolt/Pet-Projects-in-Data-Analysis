# Determining a prospective tariff for a telecom company

## Project Description
"Megaline" is a federal cellular operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which plan brings in more money.

## Purpose of research
It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. The data of 500 "Megaline" users are available: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018.
It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.
