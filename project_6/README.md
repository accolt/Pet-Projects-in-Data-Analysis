# 06. Loss analysis of the ProcrastinatePRO+ application

In this project, a marketing analysis of the reasons for the loss of the entertainment application Procrastinate Pro + is carried out. 

## Research objectives
A task for a marketing analyst for the Procrastinate Pro+ entertainment app. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been losing money for the past few months. It is necessary to understand the reasons and help the company to get a profit.

## Conclusion

Marketing Tips: 
- It is recommended to reduce funding for ads on TipTop, FaceBoom and AdNonSense channels as none of them pay off;
- It is worth paying attention to the app's performance on all devices for the US market, since none of them paid off. Perhaps there are bugs or problems with payment. It can be seen that American users are the best at converting to paying ones, but almost immediately something prevents them from continuing to use the application (they leave the fastest);
- A closer look has to be taken at the YRabbit channel and increase advertising on it, as it is the most profitable;
- It is necessary to check the application on Mac devices, as users with these devices are the best at converting but the fastest to stop using applications (probably due to some kind of failures or errors);
- It is worth making the interface on PC devices more friendly so that users can convert better. On this device, people use the application for the longest time, and it also turned out to be the most profitable;
- It makes sense to increase advertising costs for users from England (they have the highest payback).
