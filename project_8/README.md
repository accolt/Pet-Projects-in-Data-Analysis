# Researching the catering market in Moscow to make a decision on opening a new establishment
The project involves researching the catering market in Moscow with the aim of opening a small café. The uniqueness of the café is the service of guests by robots. Information on the possibility of developing the network has been prepared for investors.
# Project Objective
Convince investors in the effective development of the network and present a development plan.
# Conclusion
I researched the question of whether a café in which guests are served by robot waiters will be successful and popular for a long time. Based on the results of the analysis, I prepared a presentation for investors with recommendations. I used the seaborn and plotly libraries to build the graphs.
