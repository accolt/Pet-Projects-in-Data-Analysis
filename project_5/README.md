# 05. Studying the patterns that determine the success of computer games

The customer is the 'Strimchik' online store, which sells computer games all over the world.
Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available from public sources.

## Research objectives
It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

## Conclusion

The main factors that will affect the success of the game in 2017:

- A shooter or action game released on the PS4 platform in Europe and on the Xbox 360 platform in North America with an M rating;
- It doesn't make much sense to release games for Japan, since they bring the least income there.
