# 02. Borrower reliability study
The client is the credit department of the bank. We need to understand whether the marital status and number of children of the client affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the potential borrower's ability to repay the loan to the bank.

## Research Objectives

Four hypotheticals need to be checked:

- Is there a correlation between the number of children and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between income level and loan repayment on time?
- How do the different purposes of the loan affect repayment on time?

## Conclusion

- The results of the analysis show that the most frequently delayed payments are those people who took a loan for car transactions;
- The best repayment rate is for loans related to real estate;
- Loans taken out for education and automobiles are paid back in about the same way.
