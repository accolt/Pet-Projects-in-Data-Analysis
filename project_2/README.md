# Project description

The client is the credit department of the bank. We need to understand whether the marital status and number of children of the client affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that evaluates the potential borrower's ability to repay the loan to the bank.

## Research Objectives

Four hypotheticals need to be checked:

- Is there a correlation between the number of children and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time?
- Is there a relationship between income level and loan repayment on time?
- How do the different purposes of the loan affect repayment on time?
